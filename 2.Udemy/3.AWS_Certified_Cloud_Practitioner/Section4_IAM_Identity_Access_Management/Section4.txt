14. IAM  Introduction: Users Groups, Policies

    IAM = Identity and access Management, Global Service
    Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
    Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
    Groups only contain users, not other Groups
    User dont have to belong to a group and user can belong to multiple groups

    IAM: Permissions
        - User or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
        - These policies define the permisssions of the users
        - In AWS you apply the least privilege principle, dont give more permissions than a user needs

19. IAM MFA Overview

    Password Policy
    - Strong passwords = higher security for your account
    - In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
        Set a minimun password lenght
        Require specific character lenght
         uppercase, lowercase, numbers, non-alphanumeric
        Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
        Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
        Prevent password re-use

    Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
    - Users have access yo tour account and can possibly change configuration or delete resources in your AWS account
    - You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
    - MFA = password you know  + security divive you own
    - Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised
